## Strategies from the operating plan

- Run by the community, for the community
- OWASP Foundation enables the mission, not does the mission
- All mission areas (chapters, membership, projects, events, etc) must be profitable in their own right, able to earn and spend funds on mission in an accountable way
- Prioritize and focus on community and outreach activities that drive our mission, deprioritizing costly or stopping unnecessary activities

## Foundation Goals for 2022

- [ ] Continue adding Membership value and benefits; increasing student, individual, and lifetime memberships to 7000
- [ ] Run at least two Global AppSecs in 2022, including San Francisco
- [ ] Help drive project, event, membership, and outreach goals by implementing OWASP's first marketing plan
- [ ] Complete a comprehensive customer experience (CX) improvement program
- [ ] Evaluate and replace our Association Management System with a cloud based system, preferably able to handle chapters and events to dramatically reduce costs

## Foundation Goals for 2021

- [x] Emerge from 2021 a stronger, more cohesive community, with increased chapter and project activity, with more member benefits. *We made a small profit in 2021, up from a projected loss*
- [x] Ensure we raise sufficient funds to put on two Global AppSecs in 2022. *We have sufficient funds to put on AppSec Global San Francisco*
- [x] Increase student, individual, and lifetime memberships to 4000. *We blew past our membership goal, ending the year with 5486 financial members*
- [x] Recruit active leaders to all inactive chapters, and increase chapter activity by 25% over 2020 levels. *We completed a chapter reactivation program, one of the busiest years for RSVPs ever*
- [x] Simplify and minimize administrative costs and overheads. *We were able to reduce our overheads by more than 70% compared to 2019*
