## OWASP City Chapter ## 
**Governance** 
While local chapters operate, for the most part, independently from the OWASP Foundation, they are not stand-alone legal entities. Local OWASP Chapters are essentially small local “arms” or “branches” of the OWASP Foundation and must abide by any legal and financial duties or responsibilities imposed on the OWASP Foundation. Furthermore, local chapters and chapter leaders are governed by the OWASP Foundation through the Executive Director and the Global OWASP Board. 

* Must have a minimum of two and maximum of five volunteers to start a new or reactivate an OWASP chapter. All leaders are to reside within 80km or 50 miles of the city chapter.
* A chapter is to hold three meeting activities that are free and open for anyone to attend every year(12 months). 
* The meetings are to be discoverable on the OWASP chapter page on owasp.org. Discoverable for the registration or RSVP that has the date, time, and physical or virtual location to attend.
* Logo for chapter aligns with [Branding](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/branding) and [Word mark usage guidlines](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/mark-usage-guidelines)
    *  The OWASP® Word Mark and OWASP & Design™ Logo are registered or unregistered service marks of OWASP Foundation, Inc. in the United States and other countries. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
    * Customization of OWASP identity graphics is a way to reflect the individual characteristics of conferences, events, chapters, and projects. The branding guidelines allow for minimal customization of identity graphics. Background images, such as a country flag to identify a local chapter, may be acceptable as long as it does not obscure the branded identity. All customized identity graphics, including logos, banners, avatars, cover photos, presentation templates, etc., must follow these guidelines. Questionable practices include changing the circle to a square, altering the angle of the wasp feature, using non-branded wasp images, copyrighted images, and any other treatment that alters or obscures the OWASP brand. The OWASP Foundation reserves the right to request changes to any graphic that does not comply with these rules.

## Leaders ##
