## OWASP City/Student Chapters ## 
**Governance** 
While local chapters operate, for the most part, independently from the OWASP Foundation, they are not stand-alone legal entities. Local OWASP Chapters are essentially small local “arms” or “branches” of the OWASP Foundation and **must abide by any legal and financial duties or responsibilities imposed on the OWASP Foundation.** Furthermore, local chapters and chapter leaders are governed by the OWASP Foundation through the Executive Director and the Global OWASP Board. 

* Must have a **minimum of two and maximum of five volunteers** to start a new or reactivate an OWASP chapter. All leaders are to reside within 80km or 50 miles of the city chapter. **Student chapter leaders** must be registered full-time students and active Faculty advisors of the accredited college/university. 
* A chapter is to hold a **minimum of three meeting** that are free and open for anyone to attend every year(12 months). 
* **Meeting** is a gathering of two or more people that has been convened for the purpose of achieving a common goal through verbal interaction, such as sharing information or reaching agreement. Meetings may occur face-to-face, hybrid, or virtually, as mediated by communications technology.
* The meetings are to be discoverable on the OWASP chapter page on owasp.org. Discoverable for the registration or RSVP that has the date, time, and physical or virtual location to attend.
* **Logo** for chapter must align with [Branding](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/branding) and [Word mark usage guidlines](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/mark-usage-guidelines)
   *  **The OWASP® Word Mark and OWASP & Design™ Logo** are registered or unregistered service marks of OWASP Foundation, Inc. in the United States and other countries. All rights reserved. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited.
    * **Customization** of OWASP identity graphics is a way to reflect the individual characteristics of conferences, events, chapters, and projects. The branding guidelines allow for minimal customization of identity graphics. Background images, such as a country flag to identify a local chapter, may be acceptable as long as it does not obscure the branded identity. All customized identity graphics, including logos, banners, avatars, cover photos, presentation templates, etc., must follow these guidelines. Questionable practices include changing the circle to a square, altering the angle of the wasp feature, using non-branded wasp images, copyrighted images, and any other treatment that alters or obscures the OWASP brand. The OWASP Foundation reserves the right to request changes to any graphic that does not comply with these rules.
* **Shared Services** the Foundation offers and will provide to a chapter if a leader requests. **The shared services provided by the Foundation are to be used for OWASP chapter meetings and approved events.**
   * Submit a [contact us ticket](https://owasporg.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/user/login?destination=portals) for each service.** 
       * Meetup.com - is a social media platform for hosting and organizing in-person, hybrid and virtual activities and gatherings. It also has an API to mirror the      meeting information to the OWASP chapter page. Need to create login for [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/) and join the meetup group. 
       * Shared Zoom account - If not using the account the leadership MUST notify the Foundation immediately so as not to incur additional monthly expenses.
