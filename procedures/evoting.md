## e-Vote procedure

1. A Board member will sponsor a motion to be put to an e-vote. Motions can come from the community or the Executive Director, but the e-Vote process only starts once a Board member has agreed to sponsor it.
2. The Board member will ask for a second in the public Google group or, if sensitive, private Board communications with all Board members and the Executive Director included
3. If a second is found, the discussion period of 7 days will start
4. The Executive Director will create an e-Vote with the motion with a 7 day timer.
5. Board members have 7 days to complete their vote. They may choose to not vote, or vote to abstain, no, or yes. They can re-cast their votes if they change their mind, but only one-Vote per Board member will count, and tallied at the end of the e-Vote period
6. Quorum must be reached (4/7) for the-Vote to be valid by Board members voting in some manner, with a super majority (5/7) if the matter is to alter a bylaw or policy. Not voting does not count towards quorum.
7. At the end of the 7 days, the Executive Director will close the e-Vote, and let the Board know the result. 
8. The Executive Director will provide minutes to the Operations Manager to be included in the next month's general meeting, or if a sensitive matter, in a private Board setting agreed to by the Board.
9. Any operational actions arising from the motion being passed will then be scheduled by the OWASP Foundation.

## Moving scheduled motions to e-Vote

During the Board Officers prep call, scheduled motions may be moved to e-Votes. A sponsor and second must be found during the Board Officers meeting, and the e-Vote published that same day by the Executive Director per the procedure above. This allows the e-Vote to be completed by the Board meeting the following week, including documenting the result in the agenda. e-Votes conducted in this way shall be completed no later than 2 hours prior to the general Board meeting.

## Tabling scheduled motions

If a motion is not ready or there's too much business already, scheduled motions can be tabled during the same meeting for a later date, moving the motion to a later general meeting's agenda so that it can be considered old business at a future date. Two Board officers need to agree to the tabling.

If a vote is to be permanently tabled, this should be done during the Changes to Agenda at the general public meeting, rather than at the Board prep meeting to allow all Board members to discuss prior to permanently tabling the motion.
