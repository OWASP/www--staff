## Processing payroll

Payroll is an essential task that must be done every month. This procedure outlines the steps required to process payroll for the OWASP Foundation.

## Relevant Policies

Payroll is higher than the Executive Director's discretionary approval limit, but as it is budgeted and approved by the Board each year, the higher budget approval limit applies. Therefore, only the Executive Director's approval is required for payroll.

* [Signatory Policy](https://owasp.org/www-policy/operational/signatory2)

## How to process payroll

### Submit payroll

No later than the 21st of each month:

- Login to Insperity HR portal
- Go to Payroll
- A list of payrolls to be submitted will be shown
- Click on the payroll to be submitted
- Review the payroll to ensure that everyone is included and the amounts are correct
- Click on Submit Payroll

### Approve payroll

No later than the calendar date set by Insperity, typically the 22 to 23rd of each month:

- Login to Insperity HR portal
- Go to Payroll
- A list of payrolls to be approved will be shown
- Click on the payroll to be approved
- Review the payroll to ensure that everyone is included and the amounts are correct by doing an invoice report by name
- Ensure the total is the same as last month (I have a post it note with the amount on my monitor) unless bonuses are to be paid
- Click on Approve Payroll if correct

### SLA

This procedure must be performed once per month, and should be completed by the 23rd of each month. 

### QA / Consistency / Reconciliation Check

Every month, the payroll should be the same except for when pay rises and bonuses are to be paid.

1. Compare the amount in approval with the amount from last month. They should be the same
2. If there are bonuses or pay rises, ensure that the amounts are correct as best as possible
3. Write down a new total for the following month

## Exception Process

If the Executive Director is not available to approve the payroll, the Operations Manager will approve the payroll by communicating with Insperity HR via phone to submit and approve payroll. If the Operations Manager is not available, Insperity will automatically approve the payroll, but this should be reviewed by the Executive Director upon their return.
