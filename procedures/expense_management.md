OWASP is a non-profit, so always think of ways of saving money and using our funds to their fullest extent.

## Incoming checks

1. Take a photo of the check
2. Deposit the check in the primary checking bank account
3. Record the check in Dext as a "Sales" transaction
4. Categorize the check in Dext
5. Review. Once Dext has scanned all the fields, make sure they are right
6. Inform whomever the check is for that it has been received and deposited

## Credit Card Expenses

For all expenses paid with a credit card, the process is as follows:

1. Take a photo of the receipt in Dext, or upload the PDF of the receipt to Dext
2. Categorize the expense in Dext
3. Review. Once Dext has scanned all the fields, review the expense report to make sure they are right
4. Submit the expense in Dext

Receipts for credit card expenses of less than $25 USD are not strictly necessary, especially if the purpose is obvious such as a Uber ride or Starbucks whilst travelling for work, but it's best practice to always upload receipts for all expenses so you don't forget to do a larger expense.

## Reimbursement

If you have paid for something with your own funds and need to be reimbursed, such as car mileage, the process is as follows:

1. Create a Jira ticket in the OSD project
2. Attach the receipt and your banking information to the Jira ticket
3. Categorize the expense
4. Submit the Jira ticket and allocate it to the Operations Manager

All reimbursements require a receipt or proof such as a mileage log or fuel receipt, and are paid via Bill.com or ACH transfer. Please provide your bank account details to the Operations Manager.
