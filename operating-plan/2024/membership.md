## Introduction

Membership is one of key areas that drives chapters, events, education, and projects. Without a healthy and active membership, our Board cannot replenish itself, and we will suffer from a lack of new ideas. Membership is a key method that individuals can support OWASP's mission by becoming a financial member, which is essentially a donation to our mission.

### Goals

- 7000 members by the end of 2024, with a stretch goal of 7,500 members 
- Four membership drives in 2024
- $215,000 in individual membership revenue
- $125,000 in membership fundraising
