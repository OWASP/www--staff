# DRAFT

## Introduction

## Goals

- Increase number of active chapters to 75%
- Increase number of chapter meetings by 25%
- Increase RSVPs by 25%
- $125k in chapter fundraising activities in 2024, with 100% of chapter fundraising to fund chapter expenses

## Program Deliverables

### Chapter Customer Experience

There will be four Chapter Leader Town Halls throughout 2024, including two leader meetings.

### Chapter Swag

OWASP is not currently in a position to offer Chapter Swag, but we do want to work with chapter leaders to find sponsors to provide swag for chapter meetings, and for swag designs to be available for chapters to use, designed by the community.

### Data Sheet

### 

## Fundraising

Chapters should be self-sustaining. It is untenable for larger chapters to be funded by the Foundation. We will work with chapters to develop fundraising strategies and provide resources to help them be successful.
