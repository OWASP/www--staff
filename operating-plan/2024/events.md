# DRAFT

## Introduction

## Goals

- 3 Global AppSecs (Lisbon, Singapore, San Francisco)
- Support up to 4 new major AppSec Days regional events all over the world
- Event Sponsor Portal on OWASP website

## Program Deliverables

### Formalize and document the running of AppSec Global events, improving Events in a Box

The draft Events in a Box was given to the OWASP community in 2021. During the pandemic, it was discovered how much institutional knowledge has been lost in various staff transitions. We need to modernize and rebuild our institutional knowledge with a thorough revamp of the Events in a Box, covering small local, medium sized AppSec Days regional events, and of course, Global AppSec events.

As the OWASP Foundation is now fully responsible for the operational delivery of AppSec Global, a new relationship with the community needs to occur, with a call for volunteers from all over the world. This will lead to the ability to host a third AppSec Global at some point in the future, probably in 2023 or 2024 as the world recovers from the pandemic. In the meantime, we need to document and improve our processes to ensure that we can easily host even the largest events.

### Improve Developer Participation in OWASP Events

TBA

### Improve Event Sponsor Customer Experience

Involving all key stakeholders - organizers, community members, attendees, event sponsors, and more - we will be kicking off a program to determine how we can improve the OWASP event experience for AppSec and AppSec Days regional events. Everything will be on the table, from call for participation, event registration and other systems, attending virtual and physical events, and more.

The key objective of this program deliverable is to optimize, modernize, and reduce the friction in hosting, attending, and supporting OWASP events, eliminating (or reducing) any painful or unnecessary activities, and ensuring that all events are impactful and profitable. It should cover post event

### Develop new AppSec Global EU Proposals with the community

There are tax implications to running AppSec Global events in any European country other than Belgium. We will develop an open and transparent method to select new locations for AppSec Global EU events, and work with the community to develop proposals for new locations. This will include a call for volunteers to help with the process, and a transparent and open process to select new locations.

### Regional AppSec Days

As the places where AppSec Global events shrink, the number of locations for AppSec Day events should grow. The Foundation will help support any profitable AppSec Days proposal, to the value of $30k per event and $250k per year overall. AppSec Day events must be profitable, and preferably funded by local sponsorship in kind. The Foundation will provide a template for the event, and will help with marketing and other support.

## Fundraising

Global AppSec events are a major source of income for the OWASP Foundation. We may need to situate the events in locations that are more profitable, and we may need to increase the ticket prices for the events. We will work with the community to develop a strategy to ensure that all events are profitable, and that the Foundation can continue to support the community with the funds raised from the events. 

## Marketing
